## The Idea

This would be a place to host things like Geek Weekend and would enable us to do it more often. It is also a place for any one of us and our families to just get away for vacation, long weekends, or group gatherings. We divide the cost equally among everyone to make it really affordable.

## Ownership

The current idea is to create an organization or association that would own the land. This organizations will have members that contribute monthly fees. These fees will be used to pay for expenses. Each paying member will receive voting rights in the governing organization. The governing association will decide what to spend project money.

## Projects and Improvements

To enable us to improve on the camp over time we will inflate the monthly dues to slightly to build a savings to pay for these improvements. Some improvement would include things like installing a well and building a community pavilion.
